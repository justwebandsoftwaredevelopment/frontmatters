	<h2>WHY THIS PROGRAMME IS FOR YOU</h2>
	<p><strong>Frontmatters</strong> was founded in 2018 by <strong>St. Asuzu Alfred P. M.</strong>. He believes that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the <strong>Frontmatters</strong> can benefit at least two million Nigerian youths and probably more.</p>

	<p class="purpose">This programme is driven by his desire to see every young school leaver between <strong>ages 15 and 25</strong> who is financially challenged with furthering his/her education, attain self reliance.</p>

	<p><strong>Frontmatters</strong> will nuture you through its well and carefully selected guarnteed courses to the freedom to organize your own life, make your own decisions without needing much help from other people.</p>

	<p><strong>We value your independence!</strong></p>

			You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan or the Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true Nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.

	Frontmatters is the leader in the movement to teach the Nigerian Youths <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version control and "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
</p>
<p>
	We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/#email_list">sign up for our official email list</a> now.
