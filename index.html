		<div class="callout-copy">
	<p>
	Frontmatters is the leader in the movement to teach the Nigerian Youths <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version control and "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
</p>
<p>
	We believe there are <strong>at least a million people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href="http://eepurl.com/ggbIF5" target="_blank">sign up for our official email list</a> now.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Frontmatters is an outgrowth of many years of self-taught technical sophistication experience by its founder - St. Asuzu Alfred P. M. This site is one of the sample site he developed during his quest for technical sophistication on CSS and Layout.
