		<h1 class="callout-title">The Frontmatters Story</h1>
		<div class="callout-copy">
	<p>
	Frontmatters is the leader in the movement to teach the Nigerian Youths <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like coding, command lines, and version control and "soft skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
</p>
<p>
	We believe there are <strong>at least a million people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://frontmatters.com/#email_list">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

<h3>Background</h3>

Acquiring the Developer Fundamentals skills, you would have covered three essential tools to becoming a computer geek: <strong><em>the Unix command line</em></strong>, <strong><em>text editors</em>,</strong> and version control with <strong><em>Git</em></strong>. When you are done with this level, you will be able to collaborate with other developers around the globe, even if you are not yet a developer.
			As a technical person, you should know the basics of the WWW (World Wide Web), and this set of courses covers the essentials: <strong><em>HTML</em></strong>, the universal language of the Web; <strong><em>CSS & Layout</em></strong>, which builds an industrial-strength but simple website.
